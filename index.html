					<h2>My social life</h2>
					<p>Everybody who heard about me knows that I'm a guitarist and a singer : I have always loved music and playing is my passion.
					I also use shuttleclocks and rackets when I need to relieve myself... </p>

					<h2>My professional life</h2>
					<p>Choosing to study Business was one of the best decisions of my life. 
					What I like the most in Business is leading a team and working with people to find solutions. 
					I'm interested by the Digital Industry : It is new, fast-paced, and of the future</p>

					<h2>My Cursus</h2>
					<p>I lived 18 years of my life in France, in a little town called Thoiry(01), in the country side, near the moutains and the lakes of Switzerland. I studied in a little High School, where I learned a lot and where I could display my passion and talents.
					When I had to choose where to go for college, I chose ESSEC, at Singapore : I will never know the exact reason, but I know that it is a decision I will never regret.</p>
